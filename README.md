# BanRX-scripts
A collection of useful scripts for BanRX

### What is BanRX?
BanRX is a project set up Shay#5787 where you can mine with the RandomX algorithm and get paid in Banano straight to your wallet address every 4 hours!

To start mining, you need to download a mining software that supports the RandomX algorithm. I'd strongly recommend downloading XMRig due to it's user friendliness and variety of documentation.

With the use of the scripts provided above, you can start mining with the click of a button!
